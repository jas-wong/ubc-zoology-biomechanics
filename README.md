Find all the necessary information for UBC Department of Zoology's Biomechanics journal club here. 

# About
Biomechanics is a broad topic covering materials, structure, mechanics, and movement of biological systems at all levels of organization. This journal club will be all about reading and discussing biomechanics writings new and old, and since biomechanics is interdisciplinary in nature, we welcome researchers from all academic levels and backgrounds.  

__How do I Join?__ <a href="mailto:jwong@zoology.ubc.ca"> E-mail me </a> for the Zoom link.

__What Are My Responsibilities?__ By slightly popular demand, everyone will take turns selecting readings (see the schedule below), and for the most part, everyone will be expected to present a figure and participate in subsequent discussion. 

# Schedule
We will meet bi-weekly/fortnightly Tuesday at 17:00-18:00.
